the right time, shamane and roland platoon approched kaldevar or altleast where kaldevar was supposed to be it as a rocky deformed terrain the land was in an etenternal shade a shadow cast buy the skybound kaldevar held buy chanis the size of titans roland and his palatoon looked up in awe they were ambushed buy kimera scouts hideing in the in the surrounding sand and rock as the charged towars them roland and his platton are on guard and ready to battel disappear commanded and in that moment all that wished to harm them were cast in to the shadowy abyss of the void the reaching the edge of a massive creater formed when kaldevar was ripped from the very ground it stood on wondering how they were ever going to get up there roland and his men tought , shamane slow approched the edge with staff in hand saying as she walk heaven and earth seperate you are meet you not but the horizon you kiss a path you shall provied plaform of stone beams of wind carry us to our mother with thoes words the earth started to moves with slabs of paving a way trough the air towards the gates of kaldevar uppon that happening hourds of kimera start pouring over the walls some could fly attacking them trying to stop thier advance but shamane was unfased rolands men fought hard killing most that attacked them but sufferd casualties to platoon members ripped appart and dismemberd in front of them one decided it wanted to go for shamane after tearing out the guts of the soiders it swang its hand as the blow as about to connect with the nape of shamanes neck roland came in between shamane turned to watch him the creature then attemts to kill him and she pushes roland aside and grabs the schondrel buy the neck drew it closer and wisperd to it "perish" and all the kimera seen and unseen that were in the assalt were made lifeless it was an instant and a silent  death for thoes that attacked them she blew open the giant gates of kaldevar with her aura alone they were met with a street litterd with corpses of kimera upon seeing that the men that made it in had more confidence that they would survive the crusade they began to make thier way to where the captives were with her sight as thier guide.in the dungeon krain became aware of shamanes presence in kaldevar there was a panic amongst the kimera she made gesturs to attaract attention from the one that was gurding them when he was close enough she charmed him and put him in an entraces state he opend the cell they  were in they opend the other cells that held the captives the captives run trough the coridors and halls looking for a way out they got to  a corner where two guards were approching krain told everyone to stay still the guards were unable to see them they were cloaked but a wall of invisibltity they made it out of the dugeon now in the castle they continued there escape and were caught but a squad of organised kimera they were not like the ones that guarded them these ones were coordinated the they rushed towards krain and the captives they saw krain dropped through the ground as if it was a liquid then the entire are atarted to get shrouded with darkness they started to see each other get consumed by darkness one buy one until only themselves were left infliced with maddness, this gave krain and co opportunity to escape they saw light a way out they made thier way towards it but krain felt something was wrong the stood still and focused and warped the hall they were running the illusion broke and there it waso on the ceiling of the  a creature half man half spider it became aware that it has been exposed it tried escaping but krain didnt allow that she recognised that face and she wanst going to allow him to escape again she was goint to make sure he sufferd for what it had done,the very stone that made the walls it stood on sent him hurdeling to the floor ringt a the feet of krain he tried running away krain flicked her hand and three of his limbs were cut off he created an illusinon in an attempt to escape krain cast another illusin within his illusion preventing him from seeing her once he tought he had lost a hand came out of nowhere and grabbed him and trew him across the hall way he still had the energy to run krain used her authority to invert the space so inted of him running away with all his might he was running towards her she locks him in place with tendrils of darkness eminating from his very shadow krain walks toward him slow he starts seeing visons of how he is going to die he struggles and screams begging her to spare him crying she stands in front of him he saw her look him dead in the eyes and walks away she goes back to the captives and escape the castle.the shadows binding the nightmare kimera desipated he breaths a sigh of releif he tried to get back to the workshop to repare his body he turns and see a young boy coverd in blood with two chained blades in the shape of question marks he tries to make short work of him the boy devides him into two with his blade effortlessly he died,then he was back to where he wass befor the boy killed him the boy was also in the same position fear consumed him he started to panic and attempted runnning away the boy held his hand fort and in doing that gesture turnd the body of the nightmare kimera insideout and back again now he was mere inches away from the boy the boy jams one of his blades into his sholder and the other into his abdomen he trew the the handed with so much force that where wedged int the ceiling and floor holding him in place the boy then starts to fade the hallway begins to warp into a forest the blades decipates he lies on th floor to rest he starts to here strange sound from the woods in verious directons when they came to sight they were all versions of himself from when he was human everthing he has in personated every thing he made people look like all engulved in blood lust the lung at him beating him up ripping im limb from limb dismembering him,krain and the captives stood and what him fall into madness his body getting ripped apart buy un unknown force they watched him die a grousom death before they make it out of the castle in to a large compound, they heard a voice "you are an interesing one arnt you" krain looks to the sky and sees a man with wings decorated in gold and white images of pictures, drawing and statues from her past and she remeberd a name the name petronai
